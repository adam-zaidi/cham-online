The board game Chameleon is much fun, but it becomes even more fun when you can choose your word. My friend's and I's past solution to this was to text each person the secret word individually, but with many people this became cumbersome. Searching online, no website or app included the option to choose a custom word. Out of frustration (and a bit of procrastination), I made an online version of Chameleon that you can play with your friends, using Express.js. Simply create a lobby, and your friends can join on their own devices. Once the secret word and chameleon/s are chosen, they will be sent out to each player, and the games can begin!
